# OpenAI Embedding Similarity with LangChain and Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model via LangChain to compute semantic similarity between a query and a set of documents. The similarity is calculated using cosine similarity from scikit-learn.

## Features

- Embeds documents and queries using `OpenAIEmbeddings` (via LangChain).
- Computes cosine similarity to find the most relevant documents.
- Ranks top-N most similar and least similar documents.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
